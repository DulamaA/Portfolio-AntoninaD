âœ¨ Antonina Dulama â€“ My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my web development projects, skills, and background. This responsive single-page app includes sections such as About Me, Tech Stack, Projects, and Contact.


ðŸ”§ Tech I Use

- HTML, CSS, SCSS
- JavaScript & TypeScript
- VUE
- Vite (for a fast dev setup)
- Git & GitHub
- APIs (like OpenWeather)

ðŸ§© A Few Projects I'm Proud Of

- **Marilyn Quiz** â€“ A TypeScript trivia game built with accessibility in mind.
- **Gottfrids Muffin Factory** â€“ A playful webshop with cart features and checkout logic.
- **React Weather App** â€“ Real-time weather using the OpenWeather API.
- **Mels Drive-In** â€“ A Vue.js project that brought teamwork and design together.
- **Code-Smells App** â€“ Helping devs understand clean code concepts.

ðŸŽ¨ Custom Styling
This site uses CSS variables and SCSS to keep everything clean and responsive. Theme-friendly, mobile-ready, and built from scratch â€” no templates here.

ðŸ›  How to Run It

# Install dependencies
cd portfolio
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

Thanks for checking out my work!
